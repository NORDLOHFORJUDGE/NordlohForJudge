I currently serve as an Assistant Kenton County Attorney (since 1999).  I have been providing professional legal services for 20 years (since 1994) to the community where I have spent my entire life and career.  I have extensive trial experience and have argued issues at every level of Kentucky's appellate courts for both the Commonwealth of Kentucky and private clients.  I am proud of that tenure and what has been accomplished.  I am motivated to give back to my community through full-time public service as one of Kenton County's District Court Judges.
