I have served as an assistant county attorney in Kenton County since 1999.  I am proud of that tenure and what has been accomplished.  I have extensive trial experience and have argued issues at every level of Kentucky's appellate courts.  I want to apply my experience and still growing enthusiasm for the law as judge in Kenton District Court, 1st Div.  I believe there should always be an appearance and actuality of fairness, impartiality and orderliness throughout the decisonal process.  Participants in the process and those affected by it reasonably expect well informed and disciplined adherence to precedent when the law is being applied to the facts of the case being presented.
