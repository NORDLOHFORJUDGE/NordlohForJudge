I have served as an assistant county attorney in Kenton County since 1999.  I am proud of that tenure and what has been accomplished.  I have argued issues at every level of state appellate courts.  I want to apply my experience and still growing enthusiasm for the law as judge in Kenton District Court, 1st Div.  I grew up in Kenton County and have spent most of my life in a ten mile radius.  I know many of the voters and looking forward to meeting more of you.  I am challenging the Division I incumbent judge because if I am elected there will be an appearance and actuality of fairness, impartiality and orderliness.  There will also be a more predictable adherence to precedent when applying the law to the facts of cases being presented than what has been my experience in that Division.
