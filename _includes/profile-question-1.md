I have served in capacity as asst county attorney in kenton county since 1999.  I have tried hundreds of cases and argued issues at every level of state appellate courts.  I want to aplly my experience and passion for the law as judge in kenton county where i grew up and have lived my entire life.  I am challenging the division i incumbent judge because if elected i will be more steady and predictable when applying the law to the facts of the cases being presented than what has been my experience in that division.
