### Not Accepting Fundraising

For judges, there should always be an appearance and actuality of fairness and impartiality.  That is why I am not asking for, or accepting, any fundraising contributions.  My wife DeLaina and I are funding my campaign because the relationships we value are not reflected on money donor lists.  This decision helps us focus on the values we want to be relevant in this election.  Raising the bar of impartiality is the first commitment I made as a judicial candidate.
