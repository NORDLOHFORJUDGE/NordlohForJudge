### Respect The Process

My pledge to you, if elected to serve as one of Kenton County's District Court Judges, is that if ever there would come a time that I no longer enjoy working for the citizens of Kenton County, or should I become intolerant of due process or fairness standards that parties and their counsel deserve, I will not seek reelection.
