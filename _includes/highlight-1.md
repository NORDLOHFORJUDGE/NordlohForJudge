### Respect The Process

If elected to serve as one of Kenton County's District Court Judges, I promise that if ever there would come a time that I no longer enjoy working for the citizens of Kenton County, or should I become intolerant of due process or fairness standards that parties and their counsel deserve, I will not seek reelection.  Part-time allegiance to any oath is never good enough.  Kenton County deserves full-time commitment from its judges to address our community's full- time problems.  I have the skills, energy and experience to be the full-time difference that I want to see.
