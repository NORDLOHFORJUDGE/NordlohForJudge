# Media Release

Please know that I am a candidate to serve as Kenton County District Court Judge, Div. I.  Please take a minute to review my profile and qualifications to serve as judge.

As a candidate, I will communicate with voters in a manner that is visible and compelling enough to hopefully earn _your_ vote.  I will work hard to show voters that, if elected, my twenty years experience of preparing and trying cases will serve the judgeship and public equally well.  If elected, my philosophy, as written in my law firm’s mission statement that has served my client’s well, would continue to guide my work.

**RESPECT THE PROCESS** - When you like what you do, people are going to like the way you do it.  It’s true.  Conversely, if you dislike the work or become intolerant of the process, people are generally not going to like the way the job is being handled.  My pledge to you, if elected, is that if ever there would come a time that I no longer enjoy serving as one of Kenton County's elected judges or if I would ever become intolerant of due process and fairness standards, I would not seek reelection.

**RESPECT FOR ADVOCACY** - Be direct about what is true, right and fair.  Lawyers are most effective when they are champions of the truth.  Good lawyers discover the truth - great ones lead others to it.  The best judges let them.

This election, like most job interviews, will give you the opportunity to decide which candidate you believe is best qualified and suited for the job next term.  I will make every effort to meet and speak with the majority of voters who will decide this question. I hope that the majority of voters will agree that I am the best choice to serve as Kenton District Court Judge Div. I next term.  I will be asking for your vote.

Meanwhile, it is important to me for you to know that I will not be asking for, or accepting, any fundraising contributions.  Likewise, no committees or friends will be soliciting or accepting money on my behalf.  This decision was the first one I made as a candidate.  This candidacy is an opportunity for me.  I feel most comfortable seeking the opportunity to serve as judge by asking for your vote without also asking that you cover the costs of me working for your vote.
