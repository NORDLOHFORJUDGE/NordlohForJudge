I know from being in private practice for 20 years that its more important to resolve cases correctly than necessarily in a hurry.  Please review my qualifications and experience gained from maintaining a private law practice where competence and character sustain your success.  In my opinion, a successful law practice is a natural beginning to a successful judgeship.
