					<h1>Media Release</h1>
					<p>Please know that I am a candidate to serve as Kenton County District Court Judge, Div. I.  Please take a minute to review my profile and qualifications to serve as judge.</p>
				</div><!-- col-lg-12 -->
				<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
					<p>As a candidate, I will communicate with voters in a manner that is visible and compelling enough to hopefully earn your vote.  I will work hard to show voters that, if elected, my twenty years experience of preparing and trying cases will serve the judgeship and public equally well.  If elected, my philosophy as written in my law firm’s mission statement, that has served my client’s well, will continue to guide my work.</p>
					<p><strong>RESPECT THE PROCESS</strong> - When you like what you do, people are going to like the way you do it.  It’s true.  Conversely, if you dislike the work or become intolerant of the process, people are generally not going to like the way the job is being handled.   My pledge to you, if elected, is that if ever there would come a time that I no longer enjoy working for the citizens of Kenton County or protecting due process standards in criminal cases, I will not seek reelection.</p>
					<p><strong>RESPECT FOR ADVOCACY</strong> - Be direct about what is true, right and fair when representing clients and presenting cases to juries.  I believe lawyers are most effective when they are champions of the truth.  Good lawyers discover the truth - great ones lead others to it.  The best judges let them.</p>
					<p>This election, like most job interviews, will give you the opportunity to decide which candidate you believe is best qualified and suited for the job.  I will make every effort to meet and speak with the majority of you who will decide this question. When it is time to vote, I hope that you believe that I am the best choice to serve as Kenton District Court Judge Div. I next term.  I will be asking for your vote.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, it is important to me for you to know that I will not be asking for, or accepting, any fundraising contributions.  Likewise, no committees or friends will be soliciting or accepting money on my behalf.  This decision was the first one I made as a candidate.  This candidacy is an opportunity for me.  I feel most comfortable seeking the opportunity to serve as judge by asking for your vote without also asking that you cover the costs of me earning your vote. </p>
